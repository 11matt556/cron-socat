# Socat-Cron

Forked from djpic's [docker-images](https://gitlab.com/djpic/docker-images) project on Gitlab. 
Based specifically on https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/djpic/cron

Modified to use alpine/socat instead of alpine, removed fastcgi, and not using gitlab CI.

Mirrors from Github to Gitlab.\
